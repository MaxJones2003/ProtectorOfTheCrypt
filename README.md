2. Click on a placed tower to access the upgrade the tower.

Features:
1. Tower Placement - Select towers through UI on a grid-based system to defend the crypt.

3. Money System - Kill enemies to gain money and upgrade towers.
4. Souls System - If an enemy reaches the end of the path, it removes a soul from the total soul count. If the amount of souls hits zero, you lose.

NEW Features:
1. Option to Speed up Dialogue - Click the Speed Text Button to make the dialogue speed up or down. (Needs to be better conveyed, however audio blips help for now).
2. Bomber Tower and AOE - Created a new tower variant that throws bombs, dealing damage to multiple enemies instead of solely single targeting.
3. Weakness System - Introduced a new variety of enemies "Shield Monsters", that are inherently weak to the aforementioned Bomber Tower.

Other Additions:
- Level 2
- Refined Tower Selection screen, now opens on clicking a valid grid space. No click and dragging required!
- Efforts to make the UI more consistent. Will see more improvement moving forward.
